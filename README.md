# 🚗 BN Motors SQL

**BN Motors SQL** is a realistic, end-to-end SQL project that models the data systems of a multi-store automotive dealership network.  
It demonstrates strong database design, query optimization, and business insight generation — tailored for a data analyst or data scientist portfolio.

---

## 📘 Project overview
This project simulates how a dealership group manages its **sales, service, financing, and parts** operations through a relational database.  
It covers the full data lifecycle — from **conceptual design → ERD → schema creation → data generation → analytical queries**.

### Key learning outcomes
- Design normalized **entity-relationship models (ERD)**  
- Write complete **DDL scripts** (tables, constraints, relationships)  
- Generate **synthetic yet realistic automotive data**  
- Run **advanced SQL queries** answering real business questions  
- Translate technical insights into **analyst-style reports**

---

## 🧩 Database structure
**Schema:** `bn_motors`

Core entity domains:
- **Sales:** Store, Employee, Customer, Vehicle, Sale, Trade-In, FinanceContract  
- **Service:** ServiceOrder, ServiceLineItem, Technician, Part, Supplier  
- **Support:** Lead, Appointment, Payment, Warranty, VehicleTransfer  

See [`/docs/blueprint_v1.md`](docs/blueprint_v1.md) for the full entity list and ER diagram.

---

## 🛠️ Tech stack
- **MySQL 8 (InnoDB)** — database engine  
- **SQL DDL/DML** — schema + queries  
- **Python (Faker/pandas)** — for synthetic data generation *(coming soon)*  
- **VS Code / GitHub** — version control & collaboration

## 📂 Repository structure
/ddl/ → all schema & DDL files
/seed/ → CSVs & generators for sample data
/queries/ → analytical & business insight queries
/docs/ → ERD, design notes, and documentation

yaml
Copy code

## 🚀 Getting started
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bn_motors_SQL.git
   cd bn_motors_SQL
Run the schema in MySQL:

`SOURCE ddl/schema_v1.sql;`
(optional) Load seed data once available.

Explore queries in /queries — examples include sales KPIs, service performance, and warranty analytics.

📊 Example insights (to be built)

- Top-performing models by gross profit
- Average finance APR and lender share by store
- Service department efficiency & parts-to-labor ratio
- Lead-to-sale conversion funnel
